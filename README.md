# Colourful Elephants

<h2> MS2 project - Interactive front-end development </h2>

This is a basic matching test for a children, it's designed to encourage younger people to have fun whilst being educated and stimulating their brain. 
I have created a jungle like theme to make the web pag as colourful and enticing as possible. The game itself is not as traight forward as you might
think as there will be a 30 second timer from once you click the button and the aim of the game is to match what text appears (A colour) with the
text inside the elephant. However the 6 elephants themselves can be coloured in a different colour as to what the text inside them reads. There'll be a 
score tally at the bottom of the screen to collate the results.

<h2> User Experince (UX) </h2>

<h3> Strategy: </h3>

<p>
I understand that my target audience is young children, who will be difficult to hold their attention. With this in mind I need to make the website 
with powerful, bold colours that will initially grab the kids eyes. Furthermore I am creating a jungle based theme with animals and forest like 
structure to my web page to keep their attention focused on the screen, after I've initially drawn them in.
</p>
<p>
I have researched different childrens games to see what sort of difficulty, as well as what features are likely to be appropriate for my game.
After this I concluded that a few simple colours alog with some animals and a straightforward game with a slight twist to catch people out should
should suffice in the childrens satisfaction and simultaneously stimulating their brains.
</p>

<h3> Scope: </h3>

This is a fun game with the intent on stimulating the youth's brains and to bring about a bit of competitiveness to see who can be the reigning champ!

<h3> Visitor goals </h3>

1) As a visitor who wants to have fun:

- I want to be able to dive straight into the game with little effort.
- I want to be drawn in by what the game has to offer.
- I want to be able to easily understand the rules of the game and have perfect clarity on what to do.
- I want there to be an element of competitiveness with a score sheet and a highscore to show to my friends.

2) As a visitor who wants to stimulate their brain:

- I want to be tested in this game in a way where I don't always get the answers right.
- I want to have a goal to try and beat, with a score-sheet you can never reach the end.
- I want to be multi-tasking to try and use a lot of my brain power, thus exercising the muscles.
- I want to be exposed to many different elements such as colours, shapes, all whilst trying to complete a task.

<h3> Owner goals </h3>

- I want to bring joy to children around the world through my game.
- I want to stimulate children's brains and to have an educational purpose to it (The use of my game in schools to warm up kids for a lesson).
- I want to improve the children's perception and multitasking skills.

<h3> Structure: </h3>

<p>
I have designed my website to be a game of simplicity, yet with a subtle twist in it to catch out those eager to answer children. I have made sure 
not to overload them with too much boring details or information, in doing this I will be drawing in and keeping more people's attention for longer.
I have created a jungle like theme as I know through my research that most kids love animals and will want to interact with them, this also provides
nice styling to my website and brings about a friendly environment suitable for children.
</p>
<p>
In addition I have made sure to add in a lot of user interactivity, through javascript with elements such as a button that displays a question mark
but when pressed upon, it toggles a piece of text which turns out to be the rules. I have used animals that will be in different colours, this is
what the user will have to click upon to select their answer and after that the animals will rotate colour and the text inside them will change to
 keep the game more interactive.
</p>

<h3> Skeleton: </h3>

Home page - <p>
            This page displays a nice theme to set the tone of the game with a forest strucutre to take the user away from wherever they may be 
            playing from. In the centre lays a simple button with some text "Lets Play!" in large font to reel in most of the focus to that area.
            Furthermore there will be a set of rules at the bottom of the page so that the user is not at all confused as to hat to do.
            </p>
            <p>
            This contains the game itself as well as the majority of the user interactivity, there's a score-sheet at the bottom left (Correct answers) 
            as well as the bottom right (Incorrect answers) and then a timer at the bottom middle that will be counting down from 30 seconds. A piece 
            of text will be displayed at the top middle section of the page and this will display the colour that it wants you to match and if you 
            are unsure at any time about how to play the game, there's a little question mark button in the top left corner of the screen, that toggles
            the rules once clicked.

<h3> Surface: </h3>

Since my audience will mainly be younger people I have decided to go with a jungle based theme to attract kids with an exciting, adventurous style to it. <br>
The google font 'Texturina' was used to have a nice stylish kids game feel to it. <br>
The website favicon contains Elma the elephant, which relates to the game as it is all to do with coloured elephants. It also gives the game the capability 
to build on this in the future to become a brand for potential merchandise opportunities. <br>
The game interface is quite basic as you want things to be very straight forward for children.

<h2>Features:</h2>

<h3>Current Features</h3>

<h4>Initial Page</h4>

User is shown the player name form as well as the leaderboard for the game directly below it. Once the user types their name in and clicks the button it will start the game.

<h4>Navigation Bar</h4>
I chose to have a fixed inline navbar that was created using Bootstrap. My desktop navbar consists of a description "Colour Matching!" and then a "Play", 
"Rules" and "sign Up" button that directs you to where they are on the page. In a mobile device I have used Font Awesome icons to represent the three different
links to be more user friendly.

<h4>Main Game Area</h4>
The game area consists of a 3x2 grid (Desktop) 2x3 grid (Mobile) with an image of an elephant in each, a piece of text naming a colour will appear at the top of the grid.
All elephants consists of different colours, there's a timer on top of this grid counting down from 30 seconds, as well as an incorrect and correct score tally. Once a
card is clicked they will all change colour as well as te text within them.

<h4>Rules</h4>
Includes details of how to play the game, so that everyone has perfect clarity on how to get the bet score.

<h4>Sign Up</h4>
Straight forward form to enter an email address and be informed of future games and updates to come.

<h3>Possible Future Features</h3>

<h4>Audio</h4>
I would like to implement elephant noises as you cick on the images to make it a little more user friendly and interactive.

<h4>Different maps</h4>
It would keep the users interest if I was to create different maps in terms of changing the theme from elephants to footballs or anything that I believe kids will be interested in.

<h2>Project Credits</h2>

I learned the key concepts of HTML, CSS and Javascript in the Code Institute course materials and read further material in [Eloquent Javascript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) and [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) to support my learning and improve my knowledge of Javascript. <br>

<h3>Media</h3>

* All of my images were taken from [this website](http://clipart-library.com/search2/?q=blue%20elephant#gsc.tab=1&gsc.q=blue%20elephant&gsc.page=1)

I found information for some specific features used in the game from the following sources:
* [Inserting HTML to create the game cards](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/insertAdjacentHTML)
