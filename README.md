<h1> Colourful Elephants </h1>

<h2> MS2 project - Interactive front-end development </h2>

This is a basic matching test for a children, it's designed to encourage younger people to have fun whilst being educated and stimulating their brain. 
I have created a jungle like theme to make the web pag as colourful and enticing as possible. The game itself is not as traight forward as you might
think as there will be a 30 second timer from once you click the button and the aim of the game is to match what text appears (A colour) with the
text inside the animal. However the 6 animals themselves can be coloured in a different colour as to what the text inside them reads. There'll be a 
score tally at the bottom of the screen to collate the results.

<h2> User Experince (UX) </h2>

<h3> Strategy: </h3>

<p>
I understand that my target audience is young children, who will be difficult to hold their attention. With this in mind I need to make the website 
with powerful, bold colours that will initially grab the kids eyes. Furthermore I am creating a jungle based theme with animals and forest like 
structure to my web page to keep their attention focused on the screen, after I've initially drawn them in.
</p>
<p>
I have researched different childrens games to see what sort of difficulty, as well as what features are likely to be appropriate for my game.
After this I concluded that a few simple colours alog with some animals and a straightforward game with a slight twist to catch people out should
should suffice in the childrens satisfaction and simultaneously stimulating their brains.
</p>

<h3> Scope: </h3>

This is a fun game with the intent on stimulating the youth's brains and to bring about a bit of competitiveness to see who can be the reigning champ!

<h3> Visitor goals </h3>

1) As a visitor who wants to have fun:

- I want to be able to dive straight into the game with little effort.
- I want to be drawn in by what the game has to offer.
- I want to be able to easily understand the rules of the game and have perfect clarity on what to do.
- I want there to be an element of competitiveness with a score sheet and a highscore to show to my friends.

2) As a visitor who wants to stimulate their brain:

- I want to be tested in this game in a way where I don't always get the answers right.
- I want to have a goal to try and beat, with a score-sheet you can never reach the end.
- I want to be multi-tasking to try and use a lot of my brain power, thus exercising the muscles.
- I want to be exposed to many different elements such as colours, shapes, all whilst trying to complete a task.

<h3> Owner goals </h3>

- I want to bring joy to children around the world through my game.
- I want to stimulate children's brains and to have an educational purpose to it (The use of my game in schools to warm up kids for a lesson).
- I want to improve the children's perception and multitasking skills.

<h3> Structure: </h3>

<p>
I have designed my website to be a game of simplicity, yet with a subtle twist in it to catch out those eager to answer children. I have made sure 
not to overload them with too much boring details or information, in doing this I will be drawing in and keeping more people's attention for longer.
I have created a jungle like theme as I know through my research that most kids love animals and will want to interact with them, this also provides
nice styling to my website and brings about a friendly environment suitable for children.
</p>
<p>
In addition I have made sure to add in a lot of user interactivity, through javascript with elements such as a button that displays a question mark
but when pressed upon, it toggles a piece of text which turns out to be the rules. I have used animals that will be in different colours, this is
what the user will have to click upon to select their answer and after that the animals will rotate colour and the text inside them will change to
 keep the game more interactive.
</p>

<h3> Structure: </h3>

Home page - This page displays a nice theme to set the tone of the game with a forest strucutre to take the user away from wherever they may be 
            playing from. In the centre lays a simple button with some text "Lets Play!" in large font to reel in most of the focus to that area.
            Furthermore there will be a set of rules at the bottom of the page so that the user is not at all confused as to hat to do.

Game page - This contains the game itself as well as the majority of the user interactivity, there's a score-sheet at the bottom left (Correct answers) 
            as well as the bottom right (Incorrect answers) and then a timer at the bottom middle that will be counting down from 30 seconds. A piece 
            of text will be displayed at the top middle section of the page and this will display the colour that it wants you to match and if you 
            are unsure at any time about how to play the game, there's a little question mark button in the top left corner of the screen, that toggles
            the rules once clicked.

<h3> Surface: </h3>

Since my audience will mainly be younger people I have decided to go with a jungle based theme to attract kids with an exciting, adventurous style to it.
